    "review": "Occasionally Engaging - Aashaan attempts to capture the passion, struggles, ego clashes, and generational differences within the filmmaking world. It paints an interesting picture of how ambition collides with experience, and how cinema means different things to different generations. However, the script struggles to stay grounded, trying to explore too many ideas without fully committing to any one of them. The “film within a film” concept, though promising, feels underdeveloped. It leans heavily into the technical process of filmmaking rather than focusing on crafting a compelling inner story, which ultimately weakens the emotional payoff. Despite sincere performances from the cast, their efforts are let down by inconsistent writing and structural flaws. While Aashaan might work as a casual, light watch on television, it doesn’t quite deliver the depth or engagement expected for a theatrical experience.",

    "review": "Occasionally Engaging - “Chathu” (means dead) and unfortunately, that’s exactly how Chatha Pacha feels. What could have been a lively, rooted sports comedy ends up as a surprisingly underwhelming experience. The script comes across as low effort, skimming the surface of its characters and conflicts without investing in depth or payoff.\n\nThe editing is overly rapid, cutting through moments before they have a chance to breathe. Scenes that should build emotion or tension are rushed, leaving little room for viewers to connect with the characters or their struggles. As a result, there’s hardly any emotional anchor to hold onto.\n\nIt’s rare for me to watch a Malayalam film in multiple sittings, but this was one of them, not out of suspense, but disengagement. While some supporting actors inject occasional entertainment and energy, their efforts aren’t enough to lift the film beyond its structural flaws. In the end, it feels like a missed opportunity more than anything else.",

The investigation unfolds with enough intrigue to hold attention, and the atmosphere does its job in sustaining suspense.\n\nHowever, the film struggles to feel original. Its central theme has been explored before in Malayalam cinema, and this iteration doesn’t add enough psychological depth or narrative innovation to distinguish itself. More critically, several character decisions lack emotional or logical grounding, the “why” behind certain actions remains underdeveloped, which weakens the impact of key moments.\n\nGiven the pedigree involved, especially expectations shaped by works like Puzhu and Ela Veezha Poonchira, the bar was understandably higher. Those films demonstrated a sharp command over mood and moral complexity. Paathirathri, in comparison, feels competent but not penetrating. It holds your attention, but it doesn’t stay with you.",
